plotTopMPS2(
  MLEobj,
  DCobj = NULL,
  grpsymbol = "_",
  locYmax = TRUE,
  options = NULL,
  withStutterModel = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{MLEobj}{An object returned from calcMLE/contLikMLE}

\item{DCobj}{An object returned from deconvolve: Must be run with same object as MLEobj}

\item{grpsymbol}{A separator for each allele giving plot grouping. Useful for separating conventional repeat units (RU) and sequence variant.}

\item{locYmax}{Whether Y-axis should be same for all markers (FALSE) or not (TRUE this is default)}

\item{options}{A list of possible plot configurations. See comments below}

\item{withStutterModel}{Whether taking the stutter model into account when visualizing}
}
\value{
A plotly widget

\description{
MPS data visualizer (interactive)
}
\details{
Plots the expected peak heights of the top genotypes. The peak heights for corresponding alleles (one sample) are superimposed.
