\usage{
Qassignate(
  samples,
  popFreq,
  refData = NULL,
  doQ = TRUE,
  incR = FALSE,
  incS = FALSE,
  minF = NULL,
  normalize = FALSE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{samples}{A List with samples which for each samples has locus-list elements with list elements adata and hdata. 'adata' is a qualitative (allele) data vector and 'hdata' is a quantitative (peak heights) data vector.}

\item{popFreq}{A list of allele frequencies for a given population.}

\item{refData}{Reference objects with list element [[locus]][[reference]]$adata. The list element has reference-list with list-element 's' having a loci-list adata with list-element 'i storing qualitative data.}

\item{doQ}{Whether to Q-designate or not}

\item{incR}{Whether to include reference-alleles in the Q-assignation}

\item{incS}{Whether to include potential BW stutters in the Q-assignation}

\item{minF}{The freq value included for new alleles (new alleles as potential stutters will have 0). Default NULL is using min.observed in popFreq.}

\item{normalize}{Whether normalization should be applied or not. Default is FALSE.}

\item{verbose}{Whether printing out information}
}
\value{
ret A list(popFreq,refData,samples) with Q-designated alleles.
}
\description{
Q-designation. It also takes care of including new/rare alleles
}
\details{
Assigns non-shown alleles as one single allele (the Q-allele).
